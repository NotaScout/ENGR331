Run the Keil uVision in debug mode until you have collected the 500 data points.
Press on STOP of the debugger.
In Debugger mode, from top menu, click on Debug.
Select Function Editor
Browse to logvals.ini file. Press Save. Press Compile in the Function Editor window.

Once the file is loaded. Call the function inside the file to save the values to a log file we declared (in our case the function was called 
saveVals() and log file for value saved is ENGR331demo.log)

The saved ENGR331demo.log file should be in the same main folder where you save the logvals.ini file earlier.
